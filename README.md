Introduction
The academic performance of students can be influenced by various factors such as attendance, study habits, socio-economic background, and more. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to create a predictive model that can identify patterns and make predictions about a student's future academic performance.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains relevant information about students, including demographics, previous academic records, attendance, and other relevant features. The dataset is available in the 'data' directory.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Usage
To use the model for prediction, follow these steps:

Load the trained model (if available).
Prepare input data with relevant features.
Use the model to make predictions.
Refer to the Jupyter notebooks in the 'notebooks' directory for detailed examples.

Model Training
To train the model, run the 'train_model.ipynb' notebook. This notebook contains the code for loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, training the model, and saving the trained model.

Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using the 'evaluate_model.ipynb' notebook. This notebook provides insights into the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

Results
The results of the model training and evaluation can be found in the 'results' directory.
